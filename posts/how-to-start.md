I'm often asked how to start a solopreneur journey and how to succeed without funds and without a cofounder.

Mostly nobody in the replies agree with it. Because we always hear the story of the entrepreneur who fails because he was too focused on the product and nobody wanted to use his product.

I think most of the time, a product fails because its founder is not aligned with a clear WHY.

- Why are you doing this?
- What do you believe in?
- Why should people use your product?

You're doing sales because people don't know about the solution you're selling so you have to manually reach out to your potential clients and pitch your solution.

I like to compare the solopreneur journey as the same as of an artist.

An artist crafts something and shows it publicly. That's it. Done. No growth hacking, no cold emailing, paid acquisition, no sales pitch

## Start with a WHY

You need to be cristal clear on WHY you're doing this. Is this for freedom? The money? You'd do this
